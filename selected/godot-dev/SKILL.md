# Godot Development

## Pre-cloned packs (load on demand)

| Pack | Path | Role |
|------|------|------|
| **haxqer/godot-skill** (Codex-oriented) | `E:\Code\skills\sources\packs\godot-skill-haxqer\` | Project checks, scenes, nodes, signals, run/debug, export |
| **GodotPrompter** | `E:\Code\skills\sources\packs\godot-prompter\skills\` | Many domain skills (2d/3d, animation, save-load…) |
| **agent-skill-godot** | `E:\Code\skills\sources\packs\agent-skill-godot\` | Typing, docs lookup, GUT tests, editor MCP notes |

Primary single skill file often at:

- `godot-skill-haxqer/skill/godot/SKILL.md`
- `agent-skill-godot/SKILL.md`

## Official

- Engine: https://github.com/godotengine/godot
- Docs: https://docs.godotengine.org

## Minimal workflow

1. Confirm Godot **4.x** version and project root (`project.godot`).
2. Load the matching pack skill (prefer haxqer for Codex).
3. Scene/node changes → keep signals explicit; prefer typed GDScript when pack recommends.
4. Run from editor or CLI; fix errors before art polish.
5. Export only after run/debug passes.

## Do not

- Invent APIs that contradict current Godot docs.
- Dump entire GodotPrompter (59 skills) into context — open **one** domain skill.
