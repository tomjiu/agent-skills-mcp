# Firmware Analysis

## Authorization

Only on firmware/images you own or have written permission to analyze.

## Local catalog / mirrors

- `E:\Code\skills\catalog\sources.yaml` → `firmware`
- Awesome lists under `sources/re-security-mirrors\` (related security lists)
- Tools (install separately): Binwalk, FirmAE, Firmadyne, EMBA — URLs in catalog

## Minimal flow

1. Identify image type (`file`, entropy, headers)
2. `binwalk -e` / signature scan; extract FS
3. Inventory: busybox, web UI, hardcoded keys, outdated libs
4. Optional: emulated runtime (FirmAE etc.) only if needed and licensed
5. Notes + findings; no weaponized exploit delivery by default
