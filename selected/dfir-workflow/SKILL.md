# DFIR Workflow

## Scope

Defensive investigation on systems/data you are authorized to examine.

## Canonical tools (catalog)

| Need | Tool | Catalog section |
|------|------|-----------------|
| Memory | Volatility3 | `dfir` |
| Endpoint | Velociraptor | `dfir` |
| Timeline | Plaso / Timesketch | `dfir` |
| Disk | Autopsy / Sleuth Kit | `dfir` |

Local URLs: `E:\Code\skills\catalog\sources.yaml`

## Flow

1. Preserve evidence (hash, read-only)
2. Triage: what, when, which hosts
3. Memory and/or disk analysis with official tools
4. Timeline + IOCs
5. Report: facts first, confidence levels
