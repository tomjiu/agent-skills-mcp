## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.5] - 2026-06-11

### Changed
- Updated default start url to about:blank instead of about:home

## [0.9.4] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- Support for connecting to Firefox for Android via `--android` flag

### Fixed
- Navigation to `moz-extension://` URLs no longer hangs; now uses BiDi navigate
- Geckodriver binary detection on Windows

## [0.9.3] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- New `@mozilla/firefox-devtools-mcp-moz` npm package with privileged context support enabled by default
- `--profile-path` now uses a dedicated subfolder to avoid corrupting existing profiles, and warns when reusing a profile that already exists

### Fixed
- Profile reuse warnings are now surfaced as MCP errors so AI assistants can see them
- Network debug command now uses `statusMin=400` instead of `status="failed"` to correctly match 4xx/5xx responses
- Docker image now creates the user home directory

### Changed
- Package renamed from `firefox-devtools-mcp` to `@mozilla/firefox-devtools-mcp`
- License changed to dual MIT OR Apache-2.0
- Reduced emoji usage in MCP log messages

## [0.9.2] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- `evaluate_privileged_script` now detects `const`/`let`/`var` statements and rejects them with a helpful error message suggesting IIFE workaround
- BiDi console and network events now degrade gracefully when Firefox Remote Agent is not running, instead of crashing
- Comprehensive e2e scenario integration tests covering the full `FirefoxClient` API
- Unit tests for privileged context state consistency and statement detection
- Testing documentation (`docs/testing.md`)

### Fixed
- Privileged context state not preserved across tool calls: `set_firefox_prefs` and `list_extensions` no longer silently revert a privileged context selection
- Session cleanup on connection failure: `getFirefox()` now closes the failed instance to prevent zombie geckodriver processes and Marionette session locks

### Changed
- **Breaking:** Removed `--marionette-host` CLI parameter (connect-existing mode now uses localhost only)
- Rewrote connect-existing mode to use Selenium's native `--connect-existing` feature via `ServiceBuilder`, replacing the custom `GeckodriverHttpDriver` HTTP client (~530 lines removed)
- Replaced custom `IDriver`/`IElement`/`IBiDi` interfaces with native `WebDriver`/`WebElement` from selenium-webdriver
- Improved error messages for BiDi-dependent features (console/network) to suggest `--remote-debugging-port`
- Pinned all dependency versions for build reproducibility
- Updated dependencies: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.29.0, `tsup` 8.5.0, `tsx` 4.21.0, `typescript-eslint` 8.58.0

## [0.9.1] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- `SERVER_VERSION` now reads from `package.json` dynamically instead of hardcoded value
- Connect-existing mode: session cleanup, BiDi support, `--marionette-host` parameter
- Resolved 11 security vulnerabilities in dependencies

### Changed
- Removed fragile `process.on` handlers in test setup that masked real errors
- Added unit tests for connect-existing mode (BiDi, session cleanup, reconnect)

## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- Merged features from Mozilla's fork (PR #46):
  - Content script evaluation (`--enable-script` flag)
  - Privileged context support (`--enable-privileged-context` flag)
  - WebExtension tools: install, uninstall, and list extensions
  - Firefox restart tool with runtime reconfiguration
  - Preferences configuration via CLI (`--pref`) and runtime tools
  - Environment variables and output capture (`--env`, `--output-file`)
  - WebDriver BiDi command support
  - MOZ_LOG integration
- Repository adopted by Mozilla

### Changed
- Script evaluation and privileged context are now opt-in via CLI flags
- Author updated to Mozilla
- Removed non-English documentation files

## [0.8.1] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- Increase snapshot test timeout

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- Support --connect-existing to attach to running Firefox

## [0.7.1] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed
- Simplified `saveTo` parameter description in screenshot tools to remove opinionated usage instructions that were influencing AI assistant behavior

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **`saveTo` parameter for screenshot tools**: New optional parameter on `screenshot_page` and `screenshot_by_uid` that saves the screenshot to a local file instead of returning base64 image data in the MCP response
  - Solves context window bloat in CLI-based MCP clients (e.g. Claude Code) where large base64 screenshots fill up the context quickly
  - When `saveTo` is provided, returns a lightweight text response with the file path and size
  - Automatically creates parent directories if they don't exist
  - Follows the same pattern as Chrome DevTools MCP's `filePath` parameter

### Changed
- **Screenshot response format**: Without `saveTo`, screenshots are now returned as native MCP `image` content (`{ type: "image" }`) instead of raw base64 text. GUI clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor) render these natively.
- Removed `buildScreenshotResponse` with its token-limit truncation — no longer needed since screenshots are either saved to file or returned as proper image content
- Extended `McpToolResponse` type to support both `text` and `image` content items

## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-04

### Added
- **Enhanced Vue/Livewire/Alpine.js support**: New snapshot options for modern JavaScript frameworks
  - `includeAll` parameter: Include all visible elements without relevance filtering
  - `selector` parameter: Scope snapshot to specific DOM subtree using CSS selector
  - Fixes [#36](https://github.com/mozilla/firefox-devtools-mcp/issues/36) - DOM filtering problem with Vue and Livewire applications
- **Test fixtures**: Added new HTML fixtures for testing visibility edge cases (`visibility.html`, `selector.html`)

### Changed
- **Improved element relevance detection**:
  - Fixed text content checking to use direct text only (excluding descendants)
  - Added check for interactive descendants to include wrapper elements
  - Implemented "bubble-up" pattern in tree walker to preserve nested interactive elements
  - Elements with `v-*`, `wire:*`, `x-*` attributes and custom components are now properly captured with `includeAll=true`

### Fixed
- **Visibility checking now considers ancestor elements**: Elements inside hidden parents (e.g., `display:none`, `visibility:hidden`) are now correctly excluded from snapshots, even in `includeAll` mode
- **Opacity parsing improved**: Fixed opacity check to properly handle various numeric formats (`0`, `0.0`, `0.00`) by parsing as float instead of string comparison
- **CSS selector error handling**: Invalid CSS selectors now return clear error messages (`"Invalid selector syntax"`) instead of generic `"Unknown error"`
- Interactive elements deeply nested in non-relevant wrapper divs are now correctly captured
- Container elements with large descendant text content no longer incorrectly filtered out
- Custom HTML elements (Vue/Livewire components) are now visible in snapshots with `includeAll=true`

## [0.6.0] - 2025-12-01

Released on npm, see GitHub releases for details.

## [0.5.3] - 2025-01-30

### Added
- Windows-specific integration test runner (`scripts/run-integration-tests-windows.mjs`)

## [0.5.2] - 2025-01-22

### Added
- New test helper functions for improved integration test stability:
  - `waitForElementInSnapshot()` - actively waits for elements to appear in DOM snapshots
  - `waitForPageLoad()` - ensures page is fully loaded before proceeding

  - Boolean values and bytes format
- Global test cleanup system to prevent zombie Firefox processes
- Signal handlers (SIGINT, SIGTERM) for graceful Firefox cleanup on test interruption
- New npm script `test:unit` for running unit tests without Firefox dependencies

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Zombie Firefox processes no longer left running after test failures
  - Added automatic cleanup in `tests/setup.ts` after all tests complete
  - Added process signal handlers to ensure cleanup on Ctrl+C and crashes
